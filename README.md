The Online Attendance Management System in PHP is a dynamic tool designed to streamline the tracking and management of student and employee attendance.
By moving this traditional process into the online realm, it gains significant advantages, making it accessible from anywhere in the world. 
This innovative system offers transparency and convenience, allowing individuals to access their attendance records at any time.

The system features two primary user roles: teachers and students.
For teachers,
the process begins with account creation and subsequent approval by an administrator. 
Once approved, teachers can perform various tasks, including selecting and managing multiple lectures, marking attendance after each session, 
viewing lists of assigned students, generating downloadable attendance reports in PDF format, 
and checking the average attendance across all classes. Teachers can also update their profiles,
upload profile pictures, and reset their passwords in an encrypted format.
Students,
on the other hand, can access their attendance records for various classes, generate PDF reports, check their average attendance.

The technology stack powering this system encompasses the front end with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for responsive design, jQuery, and Ajax.
On the back end, it relies on PHP for dynamic web page generation and MySQL for robust database management.
To deploy this system, one can choose from popular server solutions like WAMP, XAMPP, MAMP, or LAMP.

Overall, this Online Attendance Management System presents an efficient and transparent solution for educational institutions and businesses, enabling seamless attendance monitoring and reporting.
